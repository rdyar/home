#Strapless Theme

Strapless is a simple CSS based theme with no JS, JQuery or Frameworks to rely on.

Demo site: http://rdyar.github.io/strapless/

Use it as a starting point and add to it if there is something you need that isn't included.

Strapless uses Flexbox in a few places, and should work on all modern browsers and devices, but will likely break on IE 6-7-8.
