	<h1>Full Width with a Side Bar</h1>
	<p>This is a simple starter page for a full width page with a sidebar on the left. Could be used for an admin page.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>The css for this is in its own scss file, it uses flexbox on the `main` element to make the sidebar go all the way to the bottom, as well as to change the background color of the main content pane.</p>
	<p>This is meant to be used on desktops, there are no @media settings to make the sidebar change as the screen width changes, it is set to a fixed width.</p>
