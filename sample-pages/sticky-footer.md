description: This pages has a sticky footer thanks to flexbox.

Pages (like this) with very little content should still have a footer at the bottom of the page rather than right underneath the end of the content.

This is implemented by using the ```<body>``` tag as a parent element with ```display: flex``` and then ```<header>```, ```<main>``` and ```<footer>``` as child elements. The ```<main>``` element gets ``` flex: 1 ``` which makes the main content area expand to fill space as needed.
